**\*\*\*\*\* July 08, 2022: KG-ELECTRA \*\*\*\*\***

This is the release of datasets designed for the experimentation of our newly proposed model named KG-ELECTRA. This model has been designed by fine-tuning the ELECTRA Model [https://github.com/google-research/electra] on the task of Question Answering. These datasets have been created by redesigning the famous Knowledge Graph datasets(WN18, WN18RR, FB15K) according to SQuAD V1.1 that is why we named them WN18-SQuAD, WN18RR-SQuAD and FB15K-SQuAD respectively. Each dataset contains two files that are dev and train.
